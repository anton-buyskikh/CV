Research Software Engineer with a wide experience of solution development for customers
seeking for new opportunities of bringing more value.
It's in my style to guide the solution from the early days of working with the customer
understanding their needs, striking the balance between high quality and cost constraints.
I currently develop the software stack for the near term quantum computers and have designed
and delivered applications and libraries used for internal and external products.
Being naturally good with communication and with attention to detail I like working on
with multifunctional teams, bridging hardware and software stack.
My previous experiences also include researching as a data scientist.

\cvsection{Work Style}
% ==============================================================================

I greatly enjoy working on complex products/features that require a team with multi-domain
expertise.
I enjoy taking a lead in breaking down the complexity, investigating the user requirements,
planing the work with the team members, and working collaboratively throughout to the delivery.
Moreover, I find the iterative approach the most efficient in the long run as it minimizes
risks of mis-prioritisation.
In my practice I find it essential to communicate with stakeholders from other functions, such as
product, delivery, IT security, marketing, to have multiple viewpoints.

During work on a project I would like to spend my time roughly like that:

discussing solution designs in their context.
