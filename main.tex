My main priority in life is spending time with the family and passing my
hobbies to my son.

We have lots of plans on getting into camping trips with canoeing and climbing
adventures.
In general bodyboarding and snorkelling are also on the top of the list,
but it doesn't
happen as much as I wish, maybe if my new job had remote opportunities...

When the weather is not that great, I find time for getting a few woodworking
projects done and playing non-deterministic board games.

Ah, yeah I can be quite a geek sometimes and have fun from math puzzle solving
such as "Project Euler" and "Advent of Code", especially with new languages.
