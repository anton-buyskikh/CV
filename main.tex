\cvevent{}{Work Style}{}{}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Priority on delivery commitments

    \item Team building and knowledge exchange encouragement,
    attention to the team vision and individual skills

    \item Inclined to automation, but understand exceptions for early
    explorations and quicker customer feedback
    
    \item Eye for detail; robust coding practices minimising human error

    \item Visualise complexity for collaboration
\end{itemize}

% I greatly enjoy working on complex products/features that require a team with
% multi-domain expertise.
% I enjoy taking a lead in breaking down the complexity, investigating the user
% requirements, planing the work with the team members, and working
% collaboratively throughout to the delivery.
% Moreover, I find the iterative approach the most efficient in the long run
% as it minimizes risks of mis-prioritisation.
% In my practice I find it essential to communicate with stakeholders from
% other functions, such as product, delivery, IT security, marketing, to have
% multiple viewpoints.

% During work on a project I would like to spend my time roughly like that:
